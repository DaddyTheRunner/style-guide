# Raspberry Pi Style Guide, v2.0

 
This document is based on the original Style Guide from days of yore. It is a work in progress; the word list is still being updated to remove obsolete and duplicate entries, and there will also be specific sections on website guidelines in future.
 
Unless the matter is mentioned below, please consult the *Oxford Guide to Style*.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation strives for an approachable, conversational tone in its materials. See www.raspberrypi.org for examples. 

##Lists  

Use semicolons for lists with internal commas. *We received bouquets from Chris, in California; Jim, in Belgium; and Bob, in Liverpool.*

Complicated lists are usually better presented typographically with bullets or numerals. Bullets should be used for lists of items with no hierarchy, numerals for lists of items with hierarchy, and for steps in a process (for example tutorials). Letters should never be used for list points. Bullet points take a capital letter but do not take a full stop (this includes the final list item) unless one or more of the bulleted list items is made up of more than one sentence, in which case all points on the list should have a full stop, even if they are fragments. 

A bulleted list should be introduced with a colon: 

*   First list item 
*   Second list item 
*   Third list item 
 
See **Titles of other works** below for more examples of bulleted lists. 

##Emphasis 

Use **bold** type for emphasis. 

##Punctuation 

Oxford commas should be used throughout; they resolve ambiguity and should be used elsewhere for consistency. *We photographed the components, a sandwich, and a magnet.*  

Hyphenate two or more modifiers before a noun unless the first adjective modifies the complete noun phrase. *The moderators are fascist-robot enthusiasts. The moderators are fascist robot enthusiasts.* Do not hyphenate adjectival compounds which begin with adverbs ending -ly. *A gorgeously constructed computer*. Be sure to differentiate between hyphens (n-dashes) and dashes (m-dashes). 

Do not use apostrophes in abbreviated plurals: *PCs, BGAs*. Apostrophes may be used when an abbreviation is turned into a verb, although it is best practice to avoid doing this altogether: *My mother won't stop IM'ing me.* 

##Titles of other works 

Titles of other works should be set in title case (first and last words take an initial capital, regardless of length of word or part of speech; all other words in the title **except** articles, prepositions of three or fewer letters and conjunctions of three or fewer letters, and the words *if, how* and *why* should also take an initial capital.)  

As a general rule with **software in particular**, check the manufacturer's capitalisation style. Many examples of software title capitalisation are in the word list below; if you encounter more, please email liz@raspberrypi.org to have them added them to the list. 

Treatment of the titles depends on the type of work. In general, titles should be set in *italics*, unless they fall under one of the following categories: 

*   Blogs. The titles of individual blog posts should be set in italics (unless the blog publishes posts under a date only).
*   Games. Computer games, board games, card games, arcade games. 
*   Magazines and newspapers. The titles of specific articles from magazines and newspapers should, however, be set in italics. 
*   Websites. 
*   Software.  
 
Italicise the titles of the following types of works: artworks; books, book chapters and other parts of books; CDs; albums; DVDs; songs; lectures; magazine and newspaper articles; films; operas; plays; podcasts and episodes of podcasts; poems; speeches with titles; television and radio programmes and episodes; web shows; webinars; and online videos. 

But wait! There's more! 

If compiling a numbered or bulleted list of titles **which are like items**, the titles do not need to be set in italics because they do not need to stand out from surrounding text. A similar list of titles which are not like items should be set in italics where they are required. 

Jemima's favourite old movies are: 

*   Gone With the Wind 
*   Singin' in the Rain 
*   The Third Man 
 
These are a few of my favourite things: 

*   Sausages 
*   Banditry 
*   *Anne of Green Gables* 
 
##Capitalisation 

First word in chapter headings and titles take an initial capital, others lower case. (Sentence case.) 
In all text, try to avoid the use of a trademark whose initial letter is in lower case (iPad, element14) at the start of a sentence or title. *iPad sales soar* is only ever acceptable if typography means that there is insufficient space for *Sales of iPad soar*. 

##Abbreviations 

Spell out abbreviations in the first instance in a chapter section, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Thereafter use the abbreviation. *The Raspberry Pi's brain is a system on a chip (SoC), made by stacking a memory chip on top of a processor chip. Using an SoC keeps the area of the Raspberry Pi board low.*

See the word list below for correct abbreviations and their capitalisations when spelt out. 

##Numerals 

Spell out numbers one to twelve unless dealing with code or units of computer storage; express 13 and higher numbers as a numeral *unless* at the start of a sentence. *Eighteen bagpipers were shown to the door.*

Subscript numerals (e.g. in chemical formulae) are fine in print, but not for online content. So *CO2* online, *CO<sub>2</sub>*  in print. 

Use the multiplication symbol × when required, not the letter x. 

##URLs 

Omit http:// from URLs in print. Use hyperlinks in online content. 

##Time and date 

Use the 24-hour clock. *1615h* etc.

Dates should be expressed *21 Jan 2006* etc. to avoid confusion with month/day ordering for readers outside the UK. Abbreviate months thus: *Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.* 

Season names should not be capitalised. 

##Race, disability, gender 

*Indian people* (or *Egyptian people, black people, Jewish people* etc.) never *Indians, Egyptians, blacks* or *Jews*. Similarly, use *disabled* as an adjective, never a noun. *Disabled people*, not *the disabled*. 

Copy should be gender neutral as far as possible. Using *they* as a singular pronoun is acceptable, and is preferable to alternating *he* and *she*, which can be clumsy and immersion breaking for the reader. Where possible, make nouns and pronouns plural: *Students should enter their passwords* is preferable to *Each student should enter his or her password.* 

Avoid gendered job titles; there is usually an alternative. So *firefighter* instead of *fireman*; *flight attendant* instead of *stewardess.*  

Avoid *man, mankind, manmade, manpower* etc. There are plenty of alternatives. 
 
##Markdown-specific guidelines 
 
The main header should be formatted as **h1**, sub-headers as **h2**. Any further sub-headers in the hierarchy should be **h3**, **h4** and so on. Never use bold formatting instead. Leave one line break between headers and the main text. 

Code and code-related words should be formatted with backticks, for example `mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()`. In large code examples, the name of the programming language should be entered after the first set of three backticks (for example, *```python*). Code must always be indented within lists to prevent the numbering formatting being broken. 

Images should not have text in the preceding square brackets []; it should be placed within the regular brackets. For example: 

<pre>![](components.png "Components you will need"). </pre>

'Smart' quotes should be avoided. 
 
##Spelling 
 
UK English should be used.
